                <h3>What's This About?</h3>
                <p id="Intro" class="bodies">For our Catalyst assignment in Chemistry 12, we wanted to look at how rain
                    is formed through the process of nucleation!
                    There have been many attempts throughout history to successfully create rain and snow
                    artificially through cloud seeding, with mixed results. To properly “make” rain, you have to have a
                    catalyst. The most common catalysts we see in nature for this are aerosol catalysts, namely calcium,
                    aluminium, or magnesium. These catalysts float through the air and attract water particles to them,
                    and when they have collected enough particles and have joined with enough others, they will make
                    rain. However, according to new research, tiny bio-particles or microbes may have a higher influence
                    on the nucleation of raindrops than we first thought. These aerosole microbes are known as
                    ice-nucleation active bacteria since they most typically influence snow and hail rather than rain.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>What is Nucleation?</h3>
            <p class="bodies">Nucleation is the initial process that occurs during the formation of a object, such as a
                rain
                drop. A bunch of small ions, molecules or atoms arrange themselves in a pattern. These often congregate
                around a central point, growing in size. This can begin from liquid or a vapour, and it binds itself to
                form
                a raindrop or a crystal etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is a Catalyst?</h3>
            <p class="bodies">A catalyst is a substance that speeds up or increases a chemical reaction, but doesn’t go
                through
                any change itself. In this case, our catalyst is what makes it possible for rain to form.
            </p>

                <p class="bodies">Shown above is a graph of a generic reaction, with catalysts and how they affect the
                    proceeding! The red line
                    represents how the reaction proceeds with an added catalyst, we can visualise how we need much less
                    energy to crest over smaller steps, rather than a ton of energy to make it over a big hill. This
                    shows how catalysts help us simplify a reaction by breaking it down into smaller, easier steps, or
                    speeding up / adding energy to an existing system to help it proceed more efficiently!</p>

                                    continues ramping up. As we know, between 0 and -10 degrees or below, we will see
                                    snow if there are any waterfalls. Nucleation is a process where the molecules in a
                                    liquid start to gather into tiny clusters, arranging in a way that will define the

                                often be thick enough to block out the sun, but not have enough water content inside
                                them to make rain. Stratus clouds specifically do not contain enough moisture to make
                                heavy rain, but might have a small drizzle at some point. Interestingly, showers come
                                from a different type of cloud than rain, even though they tend to be interchangeable
                                terms. Showers come from connective clouds like cumulus congestus, whereas rain comes
                                from clouds like cumulonimbus or nimbostratus most typically. (Cloud type visuals)

        <h2>So how does rain actually form?</h2>
        <p class="bodies">To artificially nucleate raindrops, the most usual catalyst used is silver iodide. The reason
            that we don’t see more artificially created rain is because silver iodide is known to be toxic to human and
            animals. The reaction of rain is water vapour (g) + heat → water/rain (l).

            The reason rain nucleation makes rain instead of just clouds is that when too many rain particles stick
            together, it gets heavier and heavier slowly, until eventually gravity takes over and the water has to start
            falling. If the temperature in the cloud is below zero, we will get snow, hail, or freezing rain instead of
            normal rain. This is also how acid rain is formed, but it includes compounds like sulphur dioxide and
            nitrogen oxide being released into the air and reacting with the water particles, and forming acidic
            pollutants more commonly known as acid rain.

            If there is a sandstorm somewhere in the world, (most likely large deserts) the wind will pick up the sand
            and carry it far across the earth, collecting water particles as they go. Once they have travelled far
            enough and collected enough water, it will create rain. The more sand that flies around, the bigger the rain
            storm is, since there are more catalysts to react with.
